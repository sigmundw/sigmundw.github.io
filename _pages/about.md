I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in physical geography and resource environment at [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Buda Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Su-Buda). Throughout my studies, I have developed a keen interest in understanding how climate change is reshaping the environment, particularly how it influences various ecosystems and hydrological cycles. 

My research seeks to uncover the mechanisms by which climatic shifts impact the distribution of **water resources**. By studying hydrological models and analyzing climate data, I aim to contribute to the development of more effective water management strategies that can mitigate the risks associated with extreme weather events. In the realm of **ecosystem ecology**, I am fascinated by how different ecosystems respond to environmental stressors, such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. My research explores the resilience of ecosystems to these changes and examines the potential for ecosystem services to be maintained or even enhanced under changing climatic conditions.


**My research interests include:**
- Hydroclimatology
- Climate change impacts and adaptation
- Ecosystem and landscape
- Arctic oceanography
