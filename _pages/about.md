I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in Physical Geography and Resource Environment at [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn), under the supervision of [Prof. Buda Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Su-Buda).

I have worked as a research assistant in the [Ocean/Climate Modelling Laboratory](https://canadian-nemo-ocean-modelling-forum-commuity-of-practice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Institutions/UofA/index.html#), University of Alberta, with [Prof. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers), focusing on “Climate impacts on the length of sea ice season and ecosystem response”.

I have been admitted to the University at Buffalo, supervised by [Dr. Yifan Cheng](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/earth-sciences/faculty-staff/faculty/cheng-yifan.html), and will begin my graduate study in August 2025.
